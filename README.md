## Genetic programming in scala

### Introduction

I hope that one day software engineers will obsolete ourselves. That is, we will write an application capable of writing all other applications for us. Genetic programming (GP) is about just that: creating programs that solve problems based on expected outputs for given inputs. As a colleague of mine put it, you write the unit tests and the computer does the rest.

Most, if not all, of the algorithms implemented here are based on the excellent descriptions in _A Field Guide to Genetic Programming_. I've concentrated on readability and correctness as opposed to speed of execution or even reliability, so please excuse the lacklustre performance and the fact that tail recursion is not used in places. Also note that the algorithms implemented here are, to quote the authors, "the simplest thing that could possibly work".

The snippets (those without file names) below should work in the SBT console of the project (or an IntelliJ worksheet).

### Representing programs

There are three main steps in GP (2 and 3 are repeated):

1. Generate a population of programs;
2. Evaluate the fitness of those programs; and
3. Evolve a new, hopefully fitter, population of programs.

In order to do any of those things, however, we need to be able to represent programs in some way. This is normally done by means of an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST considered here is handcrafted and only capable of representing simple polynomial expressions. There are, however, many tools capable of automatically generating ASTs from grammar files (my personal favourite being ANTLR). Here is the handcrafted AST:

###### model/Exp.scala

```scala
package model

sealed trait Exp

case class Con(value: Float) extends Exp

case class Var(name: Symbol) extends Exp

sealed trait BinOp extends Exp {
  def lhs: Exp
  def rhs: Exp
}

case class Add(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp) extends BinOp

case class Sub(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp) extends BinOp

case class Mul(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp) extends BinOp

case class Div(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp) extends BinOp

object Exp {
  import scala.util.Try
  def eval(exp: Exp, st: ST): Float = exp match {
    case Con(value) => value
    case Var(name) => st(name)
    case Add(lhs, rhs) => eval(lhs, st) + eval(rhs, st)
    case Sub(lhs, rhs) => eval(lhs, st) - eval(rhs, st)
    case Mul(lhs, rhs) => eval(lhs, st) * eval(rhs, st)
    case Div(lhs, rhs) => Try(eval(lhs, st) / eval(rhs, st)).getOrElse(1f)
  }
}
```

And a type alias from ST to Map[Symbol, Float] for the symbol table:

###### model/package.scala

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._

package object model {
  type ST = Map[Symbol, Float]
}
```

There are a three design decisions in the above code worth discussing.

First, constants and variables are always of type `Float`. There are two main reasons for this: type safety and memory consumption. Creating a generic AST and accompanying symbol table(s) would be reasonably straight forward, but writing GP algorithms that operate on them in a type safe fashion would not be so simple.

Second, the `eval` method never throws `java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero` when performing division returning `1` instead. This ensures both type and evaluation safety and, again, makes it easier to write GP algorithms that operate on ASTs without encountering runtime exceptions.

Third, and finally, both `Exp` and `BinOp` are sealed traits. This makes pattern matching easier because the compiler will warn us about incomplete matches instead of leaving us at the mercy of runtime exceptions.

#### Example ASTs

In order to better understand what we are trying to achieve automatically it is useful to manually create some ASTs and plot the results of evaluating them for various values of `x`.

##### Second degree polynomial

Here is an AST for the second degree polynomial `f(x) = x^2 - x - 2`:

```scala
import model._

Sub(Sub(Mul(Var('x), Var('x)), Var('x)), Con(2))
```

It can be evaluated for various values of `x` like so:

```scala
import model._

val exp = Sub(Sub(Mul(Var('x), Var('x)), Var('x)), Con(2))
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> -3)) // res0: Float = 10
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> 0)) // res0: Float = -2
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> 3)) // res0: Float = 4
```

This plots shows the result of the expression for values of `x` between `-3` and `3`:

![Second degree polynomial](SecondDegreePolynomial.png "Second degree polynomial")

##### Third degree polynomial

Here is another, slightly more complex, AST for the third degree polynomial `f(x) = x^3 / 4 + 3x^2 / 4 - 3x / 2 - 2`:

```scala
import model._

Sub(Sub(Add(Div(Mul(Var('x),Mul(Var('x),Var('x))),Con(4)),Div(Mul(Con(3),Mul(Var('x),Var('x))),Con(4))),Div(Mul(Con(3),Var('x)),Con(2))),Con(2))
```

As before, the result for various values of `x` can be determined like so:

```scala
import model._

val exp = Sub(Sub(Add(Div(Mul(Var('x),Mul(Var('x),Var('x))),Con(4)),Div(Mul(Con(3),Mul(Var('x),Var('x))),Con(4))),Div(Mul(Con(3),Var('x)),Con(2))),Con(2))
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> -2)) // res1: Float = 2.0
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> 0)) // res2: Float = -2.0
Exp.eval(exp, Map('x -> 2)) // res3: Float = 0.0
```

And here is the plot:

![Third degree polynomial](ThirdDegreePolynomial.png "Third degree polynomial")

From looking at both the AST and the chart you can hopefully see that the third degree polynomial will be more difficult to generate automatically than the second degree polynomial. These two expressions, one simpler and one more complex, will make good test cases for our GP solution.

### Generating programs

In GP, the leafs of an AST, whether they be constants or variables, are referred to as the terminal set. The branches whether they be unary, binary or some other arity function are referred to as the function set. Using the AST defined above the following terminal and functional sets can be created:

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._

val terminalSet = IndexedSeq(Var('x)) ++ 1f.to(5f, 1f).map(Con)
val functionSet = IndexedSeq(Add, Sub, Div, Mul)
```

With these sets it's possible to generate an AST of some arbitrary depth `depth`. The simplest way to do this is to create a `full` tree. The algorithm is reasonably simple. If the depth has been reached then return a random terminal from the terminal set. Otherwise return a random function from the function set and use the result of the next recursion as its arguments. Here is a method that does that:

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._

def full(
    depth: Int,
    functions: IndexedSeq[(Exp, Exp) => Exp],
    terminals: IndexedSeq[Exp]): Exp = {
  def loop(i: Int): Exp = {
    if (i == depth) {
      random(terminals)
    } else {
      random(functions)(loop(i + 1), loop(i + 1))
    }
  }
  loop(0)
}

def random[T](elements: IndexedSeq[T]): T = {
  elements(Random.nextInt(elements.length))
}
```

Here are some example ASTs with depths `1`, `2` and `3` generated with the `full` method:

![Full trees](FullTrees.png "Full trees")

The `full` method is simple and definitely works, but all the trees for a given depth have the exactly same number of leafs. This leads to a surprisingly uniform population. The `grow` method resolves this issue by randomly stopping the recursion:

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._

def grow(
    depth: Int,
    functions: IndexedSeq[(Exp, Exp) => Exp],
    terminals: IndexedSeq[Exp]): Exp = {
  def randomStop: Boolean = {
    val tl = terminals.length.toFloat
    val fl = functions.length.toFloat
    random() < tl / (tl + fl)
  }
  def loop(i: Int): Exp = {
    if (i == depth || randomStop) {
      random(terminals)
    } else {
      random(functions)(loop(i + 1), loop(i + 1))
    }
  }
  loop(0)
}

def random(): Float = Random.nextFloat()
```

Here are three example ASTs all of depth `3` generated with `grow` method:

![Grow trees](GrowTrees.png "Grow trees")

These two methods can be composed together to create the method `rampHalfHalf`. The idea behind this is to use `grow` for one half of the population and `full` for the other. Further, the method starts at `depth` 1 and ramps up to some `maxDepth` (as opposed to all trees being the same `depth`):

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._

def rampHalfHalf(
    count: Int,
    maxDepth: Int,
    functions: IndexedSeq[(Exp, Exp) => Exp],
    terminals: IndexedSeq[Exp]): Set[Exp] = {
  @tailrec
  def loop(acc: Set[Exp], i: Int, depth: Int): Set[Exp] = {
    if(i == count) {
      acc
    } else {
      val tree = if (i % 2 == 0) {
        full(depth, functions, terminals)
      } else {
        grow(depth, functions, terminals)
      }
      val nextDepth = if (depth == maxDepth) 1 else depth + 1
      if (acc.contains(tree)) {
        loop(acc, i, nextDepth)
      } else {
        loop(acc + tree, i + 1, nextDepth)
      }
    }
  }
  loop(Set.empty, 0, 1)
}
```

The method above is a little finicky for several reasons. First, instead of comparing `acc.size` to `count` the value `i` is used. This is because the `size` method on set is inefficient. Second, if the `acc` set already contains a tree then `i` is not incremented. Third, and contrary to `i`, `depth` is always incremented unless the `maxDepth` has been reached and in this case it is set to `1`. This is because, especially for large values of `count`, it is possible that all permutations of trees at a certain `depth` have been generated. If `depth` were not incremented then the recursion could be infinite.

> In fact, even the above method would not terminate if `count` were high and `maxDepth` low, so be careful if you use it. If termination is important to you, and it probably is, then it's best to accept duplicates and return a `Seq` instead.

With the above, it is now possible to create an initial population:

```scala
val count = 10000
val maxDepth = 5
val terminalSet = IndexedSeq(Var('x)) ++ 1f.to(5f, 1f).map(Con)
val functionSet = IndexedSeq(Add, Sub, Div, Mul)
val initial = rampHalfHalf(count, maxDepth, functionSet, terminalSet).toVector
```

### Evaluating fitness

Evaluating fitness is easier than you might think. Given some input there is an expected output. The trick is to select the right inputs. Once that is done, however, evaluating fitness is just a matter of measuring the difference between the expected and actual outputs produced by a tree. For anyone who has done unit testing with multiple test cases this should feel familiar. The only part that might feel alien is measuring the difference and then reducing that measure into one figure for all test cases. For anyone with a machine learning background this will feel quite natural though.

In our example the inputs are stored in the symbol table. The symbol table therefore is the only input. We also know how to calculate the result of the polynomial expression, so we can calculate the expected values for a given set of inputs:

```scala
val cases = (-1f).to(1f, 0.05f).map(x => (Map('x -> x), pow(x, 2) - x - 2)).toMap
```

The type of `cases` is `Map[ST, Float]`. In other words, it maps symbol tables (inputs) to expected results. Now we need to use these cases to evaluate the fitness of a given tree. To do this, first we have to evaluate each case against the tree and store the absolute difference between the actual and expected results. Then we have to sum these differences to give one final figure for all cases:

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
def fitness(cases: Map[ST, Float])(tree: Exp): Float = {
  cases map { case (symbols, expected) =>
    val actual = Exp.eval(tree, symbols)
    Math.abs(expected - actual)
  } reduce { (a, b) =>
    a + b
  }
}
```

I have intentional written this using map and reduce. I could have also used `foldLeft` or `foldRight` and an accumulator. The map-reduce nature of the algorithm should feel natural to anyone from a machine learning background and hints at the fact that this can be trivially parallelised.

You may have already guessed this, but as the correctness of the generated trees improves the value returned by the `fitness` function will approach `0`. When the tree gives the correct result for each case then the fitness function will return `0`:

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._
import model._
import GP._

def pow(a: Float, b: Float): Float = Math.pow(a, b).toFloat
val exp = Sub(Sub(Mul(Var('x), Var('x)), Var('x)), Con(2))
val cases = (-1f).to(1f, 0.05f).map(x => (Map('x -> x), pow(x, 2) - x - 2)).toMap
val f = fitness(cases)(exp)
f // 0.0
```

### Evolving programs

The next step is to evolve the initial population into a new population. There are many algorithms to evolve programs (some haven't even been discovered yet). I'll look at three:

1. Mutation
2. Crossover
3. Replication

#### Mutation

The idea behind mutation is reasonably straight forward even if the implementation is a little involved. The idea is to take a tree, pick a random subtree and replace it with another tree grown from the function and terminal sets:

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
  def mutate(
      functionSet: IndexedSeq[(Exp, Exp) => Exp],
      terminalSet: IndexedSeq[Exp],
      maxDepth: Int,
      exp: Exp): Exp = {
    val target = random(exp)
    val replacement = grow(maxDepth, functionSet, terminalSet)
    replace(exp, target, replacement)
  }
```

Note the use of two new functions `random` and `replace` and one old function `grow`. The first function invokes `collect` to convert the `Exp` to `IndexedSeq[Exp]` containing `n` elements where `n` is the total number of `Exp` making up the tree. The result is then passsed to the previously defined `random` function that takes an `IndexedSeq[T]`: 

###### model/GP.scala
```scala  
  def random(tree: Exp): Exp = {
    random(collect(tree))
  }
  
  def collect(tree: Exp): IndexedSeq[Exp] = {
    def collect(acc: IndexedSeq[Exp], subtree: Exp): IndexedSeq[Exp] = {
      subtree match {
        case v: Var => IndexedSeq(v) ++ acc
        case c: Con => IndexedSeq(c) ++ acc
        case o: BinOp => IndexedSeq(o) ++ collect(acc, o.lhs) ++ collect(acc, o.rhs)
      }
    }
    collect(IndexedSeq.empty, tree)
  }
```

The second function is responsible for replacing some node `target` in the original expression `exp` with a `replacement`. The method uses reference equality instead of value equality because there may be many subtrees with value equality. This works because the `mutate` method picks an element from the original tree. The method performs a recursive descent through the tree. The first `case` in the `match` statement checks for reference equality and if it is found then returns the `replacement`. All other cases perform a copy. If the target does not exist then a copy of the original expression is returned:

###### model/GP.scala
```scala
  def replace(exp: Exp, target: Exp, replacement: Exp): Exp = {
    def repl(exp: Exp) = replace(exp, target, replacement)
    exp match {
      case exp: Exp if (exp.eq(target)) => replacement
      case Con(value) => Con(value)
      case Var(symbol) => Var(symbol)
      case Add(lhs, rhs) => Add(repl(lhs), repl(rhs))
      case Sub(lhs, rhs) => Sub(repl(lhs), repl(rhs))
      case Mul(lhs, rhs) => Mul(repl(lhs), repl(rhs))
      case Div(lhs, rhs) => Div(repl(lhs), repl(rhs))
    }
  }
```

#### Crossover

```scala
  def crossover(left: Exp, right: Exp): Exp = {
    val replacement = biasedRandom(left)
    val target = biasedRandom(right)
    replace(right, target, replacement)
  }
  
  def biasedRandom(tree: Exp): Exp = {
    random(biasedCollect(tree))
  }
  
  def biasedCollect(tree: Exp): IndexedSeq[Exp] = {
    val ops = collectOps(tree)
    if (random() > 0.9 || ops.isEmpty) {
      collectTerminals(tree)
    } else {
      ops
    }
  }
```

// TODO Look at writing a generic collect! Maybe with a filter?


Also talk about tournament.

#### Replication

The last algorithm is very simple. Take the initial population, calculate the fitness, order the population and take a percentage (let's say 19%) of the fittest trees and copy them across to the next population:

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._
import model._
import GP._

val count = 1000
val maxDepth = 5
val terminalSet = IndexedSeq(Var('x)) ++ 1f.to(5f, 1f).map(Con)
val functionSet = IndexedSeq(Add, Sub, Div, Mul)
val initial = rampHalfHalf(count, maxDepth, functionSet, terminalSet).toVector
def pow(a: Float, b: Float): Float = Math.pow(a, b).toFloat
val cases = (-1f).to(1f, 0.05f).map(x => (Map('x -> x), pow(x, 2) - x - 2)).toMap

val sortedTrees = initial.map { tree =>
  tree -> fitness(cases)(tree)
} sortBy { case (_, fitness) =>
  fitness
} map { case (tree, _) =>
  tree
}

val replicas = sortedTrees.take(initial.length / 100 * 19)
```
